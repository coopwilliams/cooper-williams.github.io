Hi. I'm Coop, data scientist and video educator. I have a Bachelor's degree in Marketing, and for 8 years since high school, I've worked as a video producer creating advertisements and college video courses. Eventually, I started teaching video lectures in economics, finance, and computer science. That led me to teach myself data science and machine learning. I love building machine learning products, thinking abstractly, trying to predict the future, and reading about the boundary between sci-fi and the 21st Century. There is a wealth of economic low-hanging fruit that modern computing can help us pick. I try to explore that space through experimentation, epistemic humility, counterfactual thinking, and empathy.

#### My languages and frameworks
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Keras, fast.ai, Gensim, Django, Flask, Dash), PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, HBase, Docker, AWS (EC2, ECR, RDS, Sagemaker), Excel, Tableau, Rust, Scheme, Git, Agile.

#### My machine learning experience
Hypothesis testing, data visualization, regression, random forest, XGBoost, clustering, PCA, k-fold cross validation, ROC-AUC, Shapley values, Word2Vec, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, CNNs, CI/CD pipelines.
